                Never in the history of our continent has there been a dire need to fill the
                widening gap with regard to speaking African languages as there is now. While
                embracing the dividends of &apos;civilisation&apos;, the utility of African
                languages and cultures has witnessed a downward spiral in the last century. African
                languages come with their own unique beauty but have remained limited in their
                study. The solution? lzesan!, Izesan! is an e-Learning platform for African
                languages. The platform offers interactive lessons, flashcards, and exercises to
                teach users how to speak diverse African languages.

                The app is constantly being updated to include a curriculum that doesn&apos;t just
                teach users the language but immerses them in the culture and teaches them the
                lifestyle and uniqueness of the African continent. It also engages learners by
                testing their language skills and providing real-world African communication skills
                using short, illustrated lessons, online tutors, and lyric music videos as they
                acquire a new language skill set. Based in Nigeria&apos;s capital city, Abuja,
                lzesan! has over twenty-thousand (20,000) learners across iOS and Android platforms.{' '}
